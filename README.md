## Temporary Release
This version of mu-editor found in this release is only temporary, as the main mu-editor undergoes some longer term changes. Our Pull Request can therefore not be honoured now, so we are releasing this XinaBox version instead. This will be removed as soon as our changes is incorporated into the main mu-editor.
